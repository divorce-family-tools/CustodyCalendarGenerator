# Import ICS Into Google Calendar

## Step 1: Create a new calendar

It's important to use a new calendar so it can easily be deleted and recreated, if necessary. If you were to import the ICS file into an existing calendar and you wanted to delete it, then you would need to delete the events one-by-one.

Performing step 1:

1. On the left side of Google Calendar, look for "Other calendars +"
2. Click on the plus symbol and select "Create new calendar"
3. Name the calendar and click "Create calendar"
4. Click the back arrow to return to the main Google calendar page
